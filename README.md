This image is based on [bigboards/docker-rstudio-server](https://github.com/bigboards/docker-rstudio-server "bigboards/docker-rstudio-server") originally developed by KoenR3 for workshops using RStudio as X instances on [Bigboard](www.bigboards.io). It currently uses the Rstudio Server community edition so there is no load-balancing.
