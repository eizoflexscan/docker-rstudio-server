This image is based on [bigboards/docker-rstudio-server](https://github.com/bigboards/docker-rstudio-server "bigboards/docker-rstudio-server") originally developed by KoenR3for workshops using RStudio. It currently uses the Rstudio Server community edition so there is no load-balancing.

The image is meant to be run as X instances on a bigboard.
